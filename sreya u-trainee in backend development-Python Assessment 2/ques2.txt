Django is a Python-based web framework designed for rapid development of web applications. 
It provides a pragmatic and clean approach to building web applications by emphasizing reusability, maintainability, and efficiency.
 Key features include built-in components for URL routing, templating, forms handling, authentication, and database management. 
 Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, abstracting database access with its Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. 
 With a strong community, extensive documentation, and a wide range of third-party packages, Django is a popular choice for developers seeking productivity and scalability in web development.
